Hijra Engineering is a team dedicated to building excellent software and tackling interesting challenges. We focus on creating reliable, scalable, and impactful systems through a strong foundation in engineering principles.

Our Engineering Approach
At Hijra Engineering, we believe fundamentally that software engineering is software engineering. While engineers may specialize over time in areas like Frontend, Backend, Mobile, or Software Engineering in Test (SEIT), we emphasize that the bedrock of success lies in a strong, shared foundation.

Our focus is on cultivating solid software engineering principles â€“ clean code, robust design, effective testing, and collaborative problem-solving. We believe that mastering these fundamentals allows engineers to adapt, grow, and contribute effectively across different domains and technologies. This approach ensures a shared understanding and application of core engineering practices across the team.

Our Environment
We foster an environment focused on technical excellence and continuous learning. Our engineers collaborate on meaningful projects, leveraging their foundational skills to build high-quality software solutions. While we emphasize core principles, our primary technology stack includes Java for backend services, Next.js for frontend development, and React Native for mobile applications, among other tools.
